# Attachments Tests - Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Issue:** AttachmentsControllerTest was failing when running `run-all-tests.sh`
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## Problem

The AttachmentsControllerTest was initially created in `application/tests/controllers/` directory, but it requires:
- Real database connection
- Real model loading (Attachments_model, Sections_model)
- File system operations

The default test runner (`run-all-tests.sh`) uses `minimal_bootstrap.php` for controller tests, which only provides mocked objects and no real database access.

**Error when running `run-all-tests.sh`:**
```
Error: Class 'CI_Model' not found
Error: Call to undefined method stdClass::model()
```

---

## Solution

**Moved the test file to the integration tests directory** where it belongs:

```bash
mv application/tests/controllers/AttachmentsControllerTest.php \
   application/tests/integration/AttachmentsControllerTest.php
```

**Rationale:**
- Integration tests use `integration_bootstrap.php` which provides real database access
- The test inherently requires database operations (inserts, selects, deletes)
- File system testing requires integration-level testing
- This aligns with other integration tests in the codebase

---

## Verification

### ✅ Test runs successfully with integration bootstrap:

```bash
source setenv.sh
/usr/bin/php7.4 vendor/bin/phpunit \
  --bootstrap application/tests/integration_bootstrap.php \
  application/tests/integration/AttachmentsControllerTest.php \
  --no-coverage
```

**Result:**
```
PHPUnit 8.5.44 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

................                                                  16 / 16 (100%)

Time: 131 ms, Memory: 14.00 MB

OK (16 tests, 59 assertions)
```

### ✅ Test is included in integration test suite:

```bash
/usr/bin/php7.4 vendor/bin/phpunit \
  --configuration phpunit_integration.xml \
  --list-tests | grep AttachmentsControllerTest
```

**Shows all 16 tests:**
- testUploadPdfFileCreatesAttachment
- testUploadJpegImageCreatesAttachment
- testUploadDocxFileCreatesAttachment
- testUploadCsvFileCreatesAttachment
- testUploadFileExceedingSizeLimit
- testFileStoredInCorrectYearDirectory
- testFileStoredInCorrectSectionDirectory
- testDirectoryStructureIsCorrect
- testFilenameHasRandomPrefix
- testSpacesInFilenameReplacedWithUnderscores
- testDirectoryCreatedWithCorrectPermissions
- testAttachmentHelperGeneratesImageTagForJpeg
- testAttachmentHelperGeneratesLinkForPdf
- testEditAttachmentReplacesOldFile
- testEditAttachmentHandlesMissingOldFile
- testReplaceImageWithPdf

## Updated Documentation

The following documentation files have been updated with the new test location:

1. **`ATTACHMENTS_TESTS_SUMMARY.md`**
   - Updated file path to `application/tests/integration/AttachmentsControllerTest.php`
   - Updated run instructions

2. **`TEST_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`**
   - Updated file path in "Files Created/Modified" section
   - Updated all run commands

3. **`doc/testing/attachments_test_coverage_analysis.md`**
   - Updated file path in "Recommended Test Files to Create" section
   - Updated all run commands and usage examples

---

## Current Test Suite Status

**Integration Tests:** 168 tests (includes 16 new attachment tests)

**Previous failures:** 4 failures in LogHelperIntegrationTest (caused by test interference) - ✅ **NOW FIXED**

**Attachment tests:** ✅ **All 16 tests passing (100% success rate)**

**Integration test suite:** ✅ **All 168 tests passing (640 assertions)**

### Detailed Test Results:
```
Attachments Controller
 ✔ Upload pdf file creates attachment
 ✔ Upload jpeg image creates attachment
 ✔ Upload docx file creates attachment
 ✔ Upload csv file creates attachment
 ✔ Upload file exceeding size limit
 ✔ File stored in correct year directory
 ✔ File stored in correct section directory
 ✔ Directory structure is correct
 ✔ Filename has random prefix
 ✔ Spaces in filename replaced with underscores
 ✔ Directory created with correct permissions
 ✔ Attachment helper generates image tag for jpeg
 ✔ Attachment helper generates link for pdf
 ✔ Edit attachment replaces old file
 ✔ Edit attachment handles missing old file
 ✔ Replace image with pdf

Time: 129 ms, Memory: 14.00 MB
OK (16 tests, 59 assertions)
```

## How to Run

### Run attachment tests only:
```bash
source setenv.sh
/usr/bin/php7.4 vendor/bin/phpunit \
  --bootstrap application/tests/integration_bootstrap.php \
  application/tests/integration/AttachmentsControllerTest.php \
  --no-coverage
```

### Run full integration test suite:
```bash
source setenv.sh
/usr/bin/php7.4 vendor/bin/phpunit \
  --configuration phpunit_integration.xml \
  --no-coverage
```

### Run all test suites:
```bash
source setenv.sh
./run-all-tests.sh
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **test interference** between AttachmentsControllerTest and LogHelperIntegrationTest:

1. **Problem:** AttachmentsControllerTest was using `eval()` to define `gvv_debug()` and `gvv_info()` functions globally in setUp()
2. **Impact:** Once defined, these mock functions couldn't be redefined by subsequent tests
3. **Consequence:** LogHelperIntegrationTest failed because it needs the real logging functions from `log_helper.php`

### The Fix

**Two changes made:**

1. **Removed mock functions from AttachmentsControllerTest:**
   ```php
   // REMOVED these lines from setUp():
   // eval('function gvv_debug($msg) { /* mock */ }');
   // eval('function gvv_info($msg) { /* mock */ }');
   ```

2. **Loaded log_helper.php in integration_bootstrap.php:**
   ```php
   // ADDED at line 466:
   require_once APPPATH . 'helpers/log_helper.php';
   ```

This ensures all integration tests use the same real logging functions, avoiding conflicts.

---

## Summary

✅ **Fixed:** Test interference between AttachmentsControllerTest and LogHelperIntegrationTest
✅ **Root cause:** Mock functions defined with `eval()` were polluting the global namespace
✅ **Solution:** Load real log_helper.php in bootstrap, removed mocks from test
✅ **Verified:** All 168 integration tests passing (including all 16 attachment tests)
✅ **Full suite:** ✅ **All test suites passed!**
✅ **Performance:** Attachment tests execute in 129ms (very fast)

**The attachments test suite is now production-ready and properly integrated into the test infrastructure!**
