# Authorization Migration - Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-26  
**Version**: Plan v2.2  
**Status**: Ready for Phase M2 (User Role Setup)

---

## What Was Done Today

### 1. ✅ Identified Gap in Original Plan

**Problem**: Plan v2.1 didn't properly address PRD Section 6.1 requirements:
- Feature flag usage during migration not explained
- Progressive user-based testing strategy missing
- Dual-system coexistence unclear

### 2. ✅ Created Comprehensive Migration Strategy

Added new section: **"Migration Strategy with Feature Flag"** with:
- 6 detailed migration phases (M1-M6)
- Step-by-step instructions for each phase
- Feature flag configuration and usage
- Rollback procedures (< 5 minutes)
- Pre-cutover checklists
- Monitoring strategies

### 3. ✅ Defined Two Paths to Production

**Path 1 (RECOMMENDED)**: Feature Flag Migration
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks
- Low risk, quick rollback
- Can test with subset of users
- Production-ready without controller changes

**Path 2 (OPTIONAL)**: Controller Code Migration  
- Timeline: 10+ weeks
- Better code organization long-term
- Can be done AFTER production via Path 1

### 4. ✅ Fixed SQL Script for All Sections

Updated `grant_user_roles_simple.sql` to:
- Use `c.club` field to detect section
- Work for all 4 sections automatically
- Grant 'user' role based on compte 411 accounts

### 5. ✅ Created Quick Reference Guide

New file: `AUTHORIZATION_MIGRATION_QUICKREF.md`
- One-page summary of migration
- Key SQL queries
- Timeline and checklist
- Rollback procedures

---

## Current Status

✅ **Phase M1 Complete**: Infrastructure ready
- Database tables created
- Authorization library implemented
- Code-based API ready
- 213/213 tests passing
- Feature flag configured (FALSE)

⏳ **Phase M2 Starting**: User Role Setup
- SQL script ready
- Authorization UI available
- Estimated: 1-2 days

---

## Next Steps

### This Week (Phase M2)

1. **Grant user roles via SQL**:
   ```bash
   mysql -h localhost -u gvv_user -p gvv2 < grant_user_roles_simple.sql
   ```
   Expected: 61 ULM + 45 Avion users granted 'user' role

2. **Assign specialized roles via UI**:
   - URL: http://gvv.net/authorization/user_roles
   - Roles: planchiste, ca, bureau, tresorier, club-admin
   - Time: 2-3 hours

3. **Verify setup**:
   ```sql
   SELECT s.nom, tr.nom, COUNT(*) 
   FROM user_roles_per_section urps
   JOIN sections s ON urps.section_id = s.id
   JOIN types_roles tr ON urps.types_roles_id = tr.id
   WHERE urps.revoked_at IS NULL
   GROUP BY s.nom, tr.nom;
   ```

### Next Week (Phase M3)

1. Enable flag on test environment
2. Test with multiple user roles
3. Validate authorization works
4. Check audit logs

### Week 3-4 (Phase M4-M5)

1. Optional production pilot (weekend)
2. Full production cutover
3. Monitor for 1 week
