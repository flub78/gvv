# Authorization Roles CRUD Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Context:** Implementation of Create, Edit, and Delete functionality for roles in the authorization/roles page

## Overview

Added complete CRUD functionality for managing roles in the authorization system, following GVV's standard patterns (similar to events_types and membre controllers).

## Changes Made

### 1. View Updates

**File:** `application/views/authorization/bs_roles.php`

- Added "Create New Role" button above the roles table
- Added Edit and Delete buttons to each non-system role in the Actions column
- Edit/Delete buttons only shown for non-system roles (system roles cannot be modified)
- Delete button includes JavaScript confirmation dialog
- Buttons styled with Bootstrap 5 classes and Font Awesome icons

### 2. Controller Methods

**File:** `application/controllers/authorization.php`

Added three new methods:

#### `create_role()`
- GET: Displays form for creating a new role
- POST: Processes form submission and creates role in database
- Validates required fields (nom, description, scope)
- Redirects to roles list with success/error message

#### `edit_role($types_roles_id)`
- GET: Displays form for editing an existing role
- POST: Processes form submission and updates role in database
- Prevents editing of system roles (is_system_role = 1)
- Validates required fields
- Redirects to roles list with success/error message

#### `delete_role($types_roles_id)`
- Deletes a role and all associated data (permissions, data access rules, user assignments)
- Prevents deletion of system roles
- Checks if role is in use before deletion (prevents orphaned user assignments)
- Cascading delete: removes related records from:
  - `role_permissions`
  - `data_access_rules`
  - `user_roles_per_section`
- Redirects to roles list with success/error message

### 3. Model Methods

**File:** `application/models/authorization_model.php`

Added three new methods:

#### `create_role($nom, $description, $scope, $translation_key = NULL)`
- Creates new role in `types_roles` table
- Sets `is_system_role = 0` (user-created role)
- Returns new role ID on success, FALSE on failure

#### `update_role($types_roles_id, $nom, $description, $scope, $translation_key = NULL)`
- Updates existing role in `types_roles` table
- Only updates non-system roles (is_system_role = 0)
- Returns TRUE on success, FALSE on failure

#### `delete_role($types_roles_id)`
- Cascading delete of role and all associated data
- Only deletes non-system roles
- Removes records from:
  1. `role_permissions` (role's permissions)
  2. `data_access_rules` (role's data access rules)
  3. `user_roles_per_section` (user assignments)
  4. `types_roles` (the role itself)
- Returns TRUE on success, FALSE on failure

### 4. New View: Role Form

**File:** `application/views/authorization/bs_role_form.php` (new)

- Bootstrap 5 form for creating/editing roles
- Fields:
  - **nom** (Role Name) - required, text input, max 100 chars
  - **description** (Description) - required, textarea
  - **scope** (Scope) - required, dropdown (section/global)
  - **translation_key** (Translation Key) - optional, text input
- Client-side validation using Bootstrap's form validation
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Save and Cancel buttons
- Works in both create and edit modes

### 5. Language Keys

Added translations in French, English, and Dutch:

**Files:**
- `application/language/french/gvv_lang.php`
- `application/language/english/gvv_lang.php`
- `application/language/dutch/gvv_lang.php`

**New keys:**
- `authorization_create_role` - "Create New Role" / "Créer un nouveau rôle" / "Nieuwe Rol Aanmaken"
- `authorization_edit_role` - "Edit Role" / "Modifier le rôle" / "Rol Bewerken"
- `authorization_confirm_delete_role` - Delete confirmation message
- `authorization_translation_key` - "Translation Key" / "Clé de traduction" / "Vertaalsleutel"

### 6. Unit Tests

**File:** `application/tests/unit/models/Authorization_modelTest.php`

Added 6 new tests:
- `test_create_role_method_exists()`
- `test_update_role_method_exists()`
- `test_delete_role_method_exists()`
- `test_create_role_accepts_correct_parameters()`
- `test_update_role_accepts_correct_parameters()`
- `test_delete_role_accepts_correct_parameters()`

## Design Patterns Followed

1. **Standard GVV CRUD Pattern**: Modeled after `events_types` controller and `membre` controller
2. **System Role Protection**: System roles (is_system_role = 1) cannot be edited or deleted
3. **Cascading Delete**: Removing a role also removes all associated permissions, rules, and assignments
4. **User Assignment Check**: Prevents deletion of roles that are currently assigned to users
5. **Bootstrap 5 UI**: Consistent styling with rest of GVV application
6. **Multi-language Support**: All UI strings translated to FR/EN/NL
7. **Client-side Validation**: HTML5 and Bootstrap form validation
8. **Confirmation Dialog**: JavaScript confirm() for delete action

## Security Considerations

1. Only non-system roles can be modified (system roles are protected)
2. Authorization controller already requires admin/club-admin role
3. Delete operation checks for role usage before allowing deletion
4. SQL injection prevention through CodeIgniter's query builder
5. XSS prevention through htmlspecialchars() in views

## Usage

### Creating a Role
1. Navigate to Authorization → Roles
2. Click "Create New Role" button
3. Fill in form (name, description, scope, optional translation key)
4. Click Save

### Editing a Role
1. Navigate to Authorization → Roles
2. Find the role in the table (non-system roles only)
3. Click the Edit button in the Actions column
4. Modify fields as needed
5. Click Save

### Deleting a Role
1. Navigate to Authorization → Roles
2. Find the role in the table (non-system roles only)
3. Click the Delete button in the Actions column
4. Confirm deletion in the dialog
5. Role and all associated data will be deleted (if not in use)

## Testing

All modified files pass PHP syntax validation:
```bash
source setenv.sh
php -l application/controllers/authorization.php  # ✓ No syntax errors
php -l application/models/authorization_model.php # ✓ No syntax errors
php -l application/views/authorization/bs_roles.php # ✓ No syntax errors
php -l application/views/authorization/bs_role_form.php # ✓ No syntax errors
```

## Files Modified

1. `application/controllers/authorization.php` (+152 lines)
2. `application/models/authorization_model.php` (+79 lines)
3. `application/views/authorization/bs_roles.php` (+25 lines)
4. `application/views/authorization/bs_role_form.php` (new file, 148 lines)
5. `application/language/french/gvv_lang.php` (+4 lines)
6. `application/language/english/gvv_lang.php` (+4 lines)
7. `application/language/dutch/gvv_lang.php` (+4 lines)
8. `application/tests/unit/models/Authorization_modelTest.php` (+49 lines)

**Total:** 321 lines added across 8 files

## Next Steps

1. Manual testing of the CRUD operations in the web interface
2. Integration testing with real database operations
3. Consider adding audit logging for role create/edit/delete operations
4. Verify proper handling of edge cases (empty form, special characters, etc.)
5. Test mobile responsiveness of the role form

## Notes

- System roles (is_system_role = 1) are fully protected from modification
- Roles in use cannot be deleted (checked via get_users_with_role)
- All UI follows Bootstrap 5 conventions
- Consistent with GVV's existing authorization patterns
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- View file follows GVV naming convention (bs_role_form.php)
