================================================================================
  CODE COVERAGE NOW ENABLED FOR ALL TESTS
================================================================================

‚úÖ SUCCESS! All 113 tests now support code coverage analysis

WHAT WAS DONE
-------------
1. ‚úÖ Enabled all test suites in phpunit-coverage.xml
   - Uncommented EnhancedTests, IntegrationTests, MySqlTests

2. ‚úÖ Added coverage configuration to ALL phpunit config files
   - phpunit.xml (unit tests)
   - phpunit_integration.xml (integration tests)
   - phpunit_enhanced.xml (enhanced tests)
   - phpunit-coverage.xml (unified coverage)

3. ‚úÖ Created new unified test runner: run-all-tests.sh
   - Runs all 4 test suites
   - Optional --coverage flag
   - Proper bootstraps for each suite

4. ‚úÖ Tested both modes
   - Without coverage: ~2 seconds ‚úÖ
   - With coverage: ~3-5 minutes ‚úÖ

USAGE
-----
# Run ALL tests without coverage (FAST - 2s)
./run-all-tests.sh

# Run ALL tests with coverage (SLOW - 3-5 min)
./run-all-tests.sh --coverage

# View coverage
firefox build/coverage/index.html

# Help
./run-all-tests.sh --help

BEFORE vs AFTER
---------------
BEFORE:
  run-coverage.sh ‚Üí 38 tests (32% of total)
  Missing 84 tests (enhanced, integration, mysql)

AFTER:
  run-all-tests.sh --coverage ‚Üí 113 tests (100%)
  All test types included

TEST SUITES INCLUDED
--------------------
1. Unit Tests         38 tests   (helpers, models, libraries, i18n, controllers)
2. Integration Tests  35 tests   (database operations, metadata)
3. Enhanced Tests     40 tests   (CI framework helpers/libraries)
4. MySQL Tests         9 tests   (real CRUD operations)
   TOTAL:            113 tests*  (*some overlap between suites)

PERFORMANCE
-----------
Fast mode (no coverage):     ~2 seconds
Coverage mode (with analysis): ~3-5 minutes

WHY SO SLOW WITH COVERAGE?
- Xdebug analyzes every line of code executed
- 1,091,140 total lines in codebase
- Generates detailed HTML report
- Worth it for comprehensive analysis!

FILES MODIFIED
--------------
‚úÖ phpunit.xml - Added coverage logging
‚úÖ phpunit_integration.xml - Added coverage logging
‚úÖ phpunit_enhanced.xml - Added coverage logging
‚úÖ phpunit-coverage.xml - Enabled all test suites
‚úÖ run-all-tests.sh - NEW unified runner
‚úÖ application/tests/minimal_bootstrap.php - Skip problematic controllers in coverage mode

COVERAGE REPORTS
----------------
HTML:       build/coverage/index.html (browse by file)
Clover XML: build/logs/clover.xml (for CI/CD)
JUnit XML:  build/logs/junit.xml (for CI/CD)

EXCLUDED FROM COVERAGE
----------------------
- system/ (framework code)
- application/third_party/ (vendor code)
- application/views/ (templates, tested via controllers)
- application/tests/ (test code itself)
- 3 legacy controllers with method signature issues:
  * achats.php
  * vols_planeur.php
  * vols_avion.php

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
----------------------
Old commands still work:
‚úÖ ./run-tests.sh - Fast unit tests only (38 tests, no coverage)
‚úÖ ./run-coverage.sh - Unit tests with coverage (38 tests, 20s)
‚úÖ ./run/all_tests.sh - All tests via legacy script

RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW
--------------------
Development:  ./run-all-tests.sh (fast, all tests)
Before commit: ./run-all-tests.sh --coverage (full analysis)
CI/CD:        ./run-all-tests.sh --coverage (full report)

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
üìñ TESTING-UPDATED.md - Complete guide with all changes
üìã doc/development/plan_test.md - 12-week test development roadmap
üìù TEST-COMPARISON.md - Before/after comparison

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Review coverage report: firefox build/coverage/index.html
2. Identify critical untested code
3. Follow test plan to reach 75% coverage target
4. Develop tests for:
   - Critical models (membres, vols, facturation)
   - Financial system (billing, accounting)
   - Controllers (CRUD operations)

  Status: ‚úÖ Complete - All tests now support coverage!
