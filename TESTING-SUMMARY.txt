  GVV PHPUNIT TEST COVERAGE - SETUP COMPLETE
================================================================================

‚úÖ Code coverage is now configured and operational!

QUICK START
-----------
  Fast tests (no coverage):     ./run-tests.sh
  Tests with coverage:          ./run-coverage.sh
  View coverage report:         firefox build/coverage/index.html

CURRENT STATUS
--------------
  Tests:        38 passing (220 assertions)
  Coverage:     0.36% baseline (3,882 / 1,091,140 lines)
  Performance:  ~100ms (fast) / ~20s (with coverage)

KEY FILES CREATED
-----------------
  ‚úÖ phpunit-coverage.xml       - Coverage configuration
  ‚úÖ run-tests.sh               - Fast test runner
  ‚úÖ run-coverage.sh            - Coverage report generator
  ‚úÖ TESTING.md                 - Testing guide
  ‚úÖ doc/development/plan_test.md - Comprehensive test plan (updated)

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------
  PHP:          7.4.33 (/usr/bin/php7.4)
  PHPUnit:      8.5.44
  Coverage:     Xdebug 3.1.6
  Mode:         Automatically set by run-coverage.sh

COVERAGE REPORTS
----------------
  HTML:         build/coverage/index.html (detailed, browsable)
  Clover XML:   build/logs/clover.xml (CI/CD integration)
  Text:         Console output with summary

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------
  3 legacy controllers excluded from coverage (method signature issues):
    - application/controllers/achats.php
    - application/controllers/vols_planeur.php  
    - application/controllers/vols_avion.php
  
  These will be refactored in future updates.

NEXT STEPS
----------
  1. Activate enhanced & integration test suites (Phase 1.2)
  2. Develop critical model tests (Phase 2)
  3. Target: 75% coverage by end of 12-week plan
