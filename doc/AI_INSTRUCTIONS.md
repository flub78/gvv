# AI Instructions for GVV Project

This file provides comprehensive guidance for AI assistants (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, and others) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**GVV (Gestion Vol à voile)** is a web application for managing gliding clubs, developed in PHP since 2011. It handles member management, aircraft fleet management, flight logging, billing, basic accounting, flight calendars, and email communications. Currently used by 5-6 gliding associations.

- **Languages**: PHP 7.4, MySQL 5.x, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Framework**: CodeIgniter 2.x (legacy version), Bootstrap 5 for UI
- **Database**: MySQL with migrations managed via CodeIgniter
- **Size**: ~50 controllers, extensive model layer, multi-language support (French, English, Dutch)
- **Status**: Deployed for 12 years, stable, in maintenance mode

---

## Critical: Environment Setup

**ALWAYS source the environment setup before running PHP commands:**

```bash
source setenv.sh
```

This sets PHP 7.4 as the active version. The project **requires PHP 7.4 specifically** - newer versions are not compatible.

---

## Common Development Commands

### Testing

```bash
# All phpunit test suites with no coverage - fast
./run-all-tests.sh

# All phpunit test suites with coverage - ~60 seconds
./run-all-tests.sh --coverage

# All test suites without coverage - ~2 seconds
./run-all-tests.sh

# View coverage report
firefox build/coverage/index.html

# End to end tests
cd playwright; npx playwright test --reporter=line   
```

### PHP Validation

```bash
# Validate individual file
php -l application/controllers/welcome.php

# Validate entire directory
find application/controllers -name "*.php" -exec php -l {} \;
```

### Test Organization

- **Unit Tests**: `application/tests/unit/` - Helpers, models, libraries, i18n
- **Integration Tests**: `application/tests/integration/` - Real database operations, metadata
- **Enhanced Tests**: `application/tests/enhanced/` - CI framework helpers/libraries
- **Controller Tests**: `application/tests/controllers/` - JSON/HTML/CSV output parsing
- **MySQL Tests**: `application/tests/mysql/` - Real database CRUD operations

Current status: ~128 tests across all suites

---

## High-Level Architecture

### Data-Driven Metadata System

GVV uses a **metadata-driven architecture** centered on `application/libraries/Gvvmetadata.php`. This class defines:

- Database field types, subtypes, and display properties
- Form element rendering (selectors, enumerations, currency, dates)
- Table view generation and formatting
- Input validation rules

**Critical**: When adding new features or modifying existing ones:
1. Define metadata in `Gvvmetadata.php` for proper field rendering
2. Use `$this->gvvmetadata->table()` for table views
3. Use metadata-aware helpers (`array_field`, `input_field`) for forms
4. Follow the established pattern: check logs for missing metadata definitions

### CodeIgniter 2.x MVC Pattern

```

### Development Workflow for New Features

Following `doc/development/workflow.md`:

0. **Design**:
   - Create markdown document in `doc/design_notes` to explain the new feature and its architecture.
   - Create plantuml diagram to explain complex design

1. **Database Migration**:
   - Define table in phpMyAdmin and export schema
   - Create migration in `application/migrations/` (numbered, e.g., `042_feature_name.php`)
   - Update `application/config/migration.php` to latest version number

2. **Model Creation**:
   - Create in `application/models/`
   - Ensure `select_page()` returns primary key even if not displayed
   - Implement joins in `select_page()` for related data

3. **Metadata Definition**:
   - Add field definitions to `application/libraries/Gvvmetadata.php`
   - Define types, subtypes, selectors, enumerations
   - Check logs for missing metadata: `DEBUG - GVV: input_field(...) type=..., subtype=...`

4. **Controller Creation**:
   - Create in `application/controllers/`
   - Extend `CI_Controller` or `Gvv_Controller`
   - Use metadata for form/table generation

5. **Language Files**:
   - Add translations to `application/language/french/`, `english/`, `dutch/`

6. **Views**:
   - Use Bootstrap 5 classes
   - Leverage `$this->gvvmetadata->table()` for table views
   - Use `array_field()` and `input_field()` for proper field rendering

7. **Testing**:
   - Create PHPUnit tests in appropriate `application/tests/` directory
   - Aim for >70% code coverage
   - Update test configs if needed

### Migration and Legacy Code

- **Legacy migration ongoing**: Converting from CodeIgniter Unit_test to PHPUnit (see `PHPUNIT_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`)
- **32 controllers** still have old CI Unit_test methods (to be migrated)
- Avoid major architectural changes - this is a maintenance-mode project
- **Code reuse first**: Always check if similar functionality exists before writing new code

---

## Key Development Guidelines

1. **Environment**: ALWAYS `source setenv.sh` before running PHP commands
2. **PHP 7.4 Only**: Use `/usr/bin/php7.4` explicitly when needed
3. **Metadata-Driven**: Define field metadata in `Gvvmetadata.php` for proper rendering
4. **Code Reuse**: Check existing code before creating new implementations
5. **Bootstrap UI**: Use Bootstrap 5 classes for all UI components
6. **Testing**: Write PHPUnit tests, aim for >70% coverage
7. **Migrations**: Always update `config/migration.php` after creating migration
8. **Multi-language**: Support French, English, Dutch in language files
9. **Permissions**: Web-writable directories need `chmod +wx` (logs, uploads, assets/images)
10. **No Composer**: Project uses manual dependency management (predates Composer)
11. **Database access**: Use the credential from configuration/database.php to analyze the database schema or data.
12. **Diagrams**: Use plantuml to generate class diagrams and database schemas
13. **Mockups**: generate mockups in ASCII art, generate prototypes in self contained HTML files
14. **GUI**: keep it as user friendly as possible. Never reject an action silently. The result of every action must be obvious to the user.

## Important Integration Patterns

### Form Generation with Metadata
```php
// In controller
$data = $this->model->get_record($id);
// In view - metadata handles rendering
echo $this->gvvmetadata->input_field('table_name', 'field_name', $value, $mode);
```

### Table Views with Metadata
```php
// Controller prepares data
$rows = $this->model->select_page($filters);
// View uses metadata for table generation
echo $this->gvvmetadata->table('view_name', $attrs, $filters);
```

### Selectors and Enumerations
Define in Gvvmetadata.php:
```php
$this->field['table']['field']['Subtype'] = 'selector';
$this->field['table']['field']['Selector'] = 'selector_function_name';
```

---

## Testing Philosophy

- **Fast iteration**: Use `./run-tests.sh` (no coverage) during development
- **Pre-commit**: Use `./run-coverage.sh` for coverage before commits
- **Full suite**: Use `./run-all-tests.sh --coverage` for comprehensive validation
- **Unit tests**: No database dependencies, test helpers/libraries in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Real database operations, test component interactions
- **Coverage target**: Aim for 75% overall (currently establishing baseline)
- **Temporary tests**: Every times that you write a test to validate a modification evaluate if it is worth creating a phpunit test and adding it to the test base. Keep all phpunit tests that demonstrate that a bug has been fixed.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't skip `source setenv.sh`** - PHP version mismatch causes failures
2. **Don't modify `system/`** - It's CodeIgniter core
3. **Don't create new patterns** - Follow established CodeIgniter 2.x conventions
4. **Don't skip metadata** - Tables/forms won't render correctly without it
5. **Don't forget migration version** - Update `config/migration.php` after creating migration
6. **Don't duplicate code** - Extensive codebase likely has what you need
7. **Don't use Composer** - Project uses manual dependency management

---

## Multi-Language Support

All user-facing strings must be defined in language files:
- `application/language/french/` (primary)
- `application/language/english/`
- `application/language/dutch/`

Use: `$this->lang->line('key_name')` in controllers/views

---

## File Permissions

Ensure these directories are web-writable:
```bash
chmod +wx application/logs
chmod +wx uploads
chmod +wx assets/images
```

---

## Third-Party Libraries

Located in `application/third_party/`:
- **TCPDF**: PDF generation
- **phpqrcode**: QR code generation
- **Google API**: Google integration
- **CIUnit**: Legacy testing framework (being phased out)

Handle with care - these are external dependencies.

## Prompt Guidelines

When working with AI assistants on GVV:

1. **Reference context**: "Context: GVV project (see AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md)"
2. **Be specific**: Focus on exact requirements, not general architecture
3. **Show integration**: Explain how changes connect to existing GVV components
4. **Work incrementally**: Break complex changes into reviewable steps
5. **Ask when unclear**: Request clarification before proceeding
6. **Reuse first**: Check existing implementations before writing new code
