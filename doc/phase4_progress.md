## Integration Points

### Controller Methods Used
All views interact with `/application/controllers/authorization.php`:
- ✅ `index()` - Dashboard
- ✅ `user_roles()` - User management
- ✅ `edit_user_roles()` - AJAX grant/revoke (used by user_roles view)
- ✅ `roles()` - Roles list
- ✅ `role_permissions($types_roles_id)` - Permissions management
- ✅ `add_permission()` - AJAX add permission
- ✅ `remove_permission()` - AJAX remove permission
- ✅ `data_access_rules($types_roles_id)` - Data rules management
- ✅ `add_data_access_rule()` - AJAX add data rule
- ✅ `remove_data_access_rule()` - AJAX remove data rule
- ✅ `audit_log($page)` - Audit log viewer

### JavaScript Dependencies
- **jQuery** - Already loaded in bs_header
- **Bootstrap 5** - Already loaded
- **DataTables** - Already used in GVV
- **FontAwesome** - Already used in GVV

### Menu Integration ✅
Added to `application/views/bs_menu.php` in the "Admin → Club Admin" submenu (line 104):

```php
<li><a class="dropdown-item" href="<?= controller_url("authorization") ?>">
    <i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> <?= translation("authorization_title") ?>
</a></li>
```

The menu item is accessible to users with the `ca` (Conseil d'Administration) role, which includes club administrators.
