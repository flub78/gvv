## Current Status Summary

### ✅ Completed Phases (0-4)

**Phase 0-2: Infrastructure & Data** ✅
- Database schema migrated (042_authorization_refactoring.php)
- Data migration complete (043_populate_authorization_data.php)
- Tables: `types_roles`, `role_permissions`, `data_access_rules`, `user_roles_per_section`, `authorization_audit_log`
- 24 default data access rules created
- Role translations (FR/EN/NL) added

**Phase 3: Authorization Library** ✅
- `Gvv_Authorization` library (480 lines) - Core authorization logic
- `Authorization_model` (388 lines) - Database operations
- Feature flag in `gvv_config.php` (disabled in production)
- Unit tests: 26 tests passing, 52 assertions (100% pass rate)
- Test bootstraps enhanced with proper CI mocks

**Phase 4: UI Implementation** ✅
- `Authorization` controller (445 lines, 11 endpoints)
- 8 views created (1,648 lines): dashboard, user_roles, roles, select pages, permissions, data rules, audit log
- Language translations: 207 keys (FR/EN/NL)
- Menu integration: Admin → Club Admin → Gestion des autorisations
- Features: Bootstrap 5, DataTables, AJAX, breadcrumbs, badges
- **Testing Pending**: End-to-end workflow, mobile responsive validation

### User Roles Modal - Improved Architecture

The current implementation of the user roles modal is sensitive to timing issues, especially when dealing with the "Toutes sections" (All sections) checkbox. To address this, the architecture will be updated to a more robust, backend-driven model.

**New Architecture:**

1.  **Client-Side Action:** When a user clicks a checkbox (e.g., to grant or revoke a role, or select "All sections"), an AJAX request is sent to the backend. The request includes the user ID, the role ID, the section ID (if applicable), and the action (grant/revoke).

2.  **Backend Processing:** The `Authorization` controller receives the request. It calls the `Authorization_model` to update the `user_roles_per_section` table in the database.

3.  **Backend Response:** After successfully updating the database, the backend will fetch the user's complete and updated list of roles and their corresponding sections. This list will be returned to the client as a JSON response.

4.  **Client-Side Update:** The frontend JavaScript code receives the JSON response. It then re-renders the checkboxes in the modal to accurately reflect the new state of the user's authorizations.

**Benefits of this approach:**

*   **Eliminates Timing Issues:** The state of the checkboxes is always driven by the authoritative data from the backend, eliminating any client-side race conditions or synchronization problems.
*   **Single Source of Truth:** The database remains the single source of truth for user authorizations. The UI is simply a reflection of this data.
*   **Improved Reliability:** The new architecture is more resilient and less prone to errors, providing a more stable user experience.
*   **Simplified Frontend Logic:** The client-side code becomes simpler, as it no longer needs to manually track the state of checkboxes. It only needs to update the UI based on the backend's response.

## Upcoming Phases

### Phase 6: Progressive Migration - Dual Mode 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Objectives**:
- Implement dual-mode authorization in Gvv_Controller
- Create migration dashboard and tracking
- Migrate users progressively by role groups

**Planning Documents Created**:
- [x] `doc/plans_and_progress/phase6_dual_mode_architecture.md` - Technical architecture design
- [x] `doc/plans_and_progress/phase6_migration_dashboard_mockups.md` - Dashboard UI mockups
- [x] `doc/diagrams/phase6_dual_mode_architecture.puml` - PlantUML architecture diagram
- [x] Test user identification (bin/create_test_users.sh - 6 pilot users)

**Pilot Users** (from bin/create_test_users.sh):
- Wave 1: `testuser` (basic member - low risk)
- Wave 2: `testplanchiste` (planning permissions - medium complexity)
- Wave 3: `testadmin` (global admin - high complexity)
- Backup: `testca`, `testbureau`, `testtresorier`

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [x] Create `application/core/Gvv_Controller.php` base class (384 lines)
- [x] Create migration 046 for `authorization_comparison_log` table
- [x] Implement dual-mode routing logic in Gvv_Controller
- [x] Verify `get_migration_status()` exists in Authorization_model
- [x] Build migration dashboard UI (4 tabs: Overview, Pilot Users, Comparison Log, Statistics)
- [x] Create migration wizard workflow (4-step modal)
- [x] Implement rollback functionality in dashboard
- [x] Add AJAX endpoints for migration operations (migrate, rollback, complete)
- [ ] Add language translations (FR/EN/NL) for migration dashboard
- [ ] Convert pilot controllers to extend Gvv_Controller (Members, Vols_planeur, Authorization)
- [ ] Wave 1 migration: testuser (7-day monitoring)
- [ ] Wave 2 migration: testplanchiste (7-day monitoring)
- [ ] Wave 3 migration: testadmin (7-day monitoring)

### Phase 7: Full Deployment (Week 11)

**Cutover**:
- [ ] Set feature flag to TRUE globally
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] 48-hour intensive monitoring
- [ ] User communication
- [ ] Rollback plan ready

### Phase 8: Cleanup & Documentation (Week 12)

**Finalization**:
- [ ] Rename old tables (preserve for rollback)
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Create admin user guide
- [ ] Administrator training
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Project retrospective

## Migration Status Dashboard

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Overall Progress** | 100% | ~50% | 🟡 In Progress |
| **Users Migrated** | 292 | 0 | 🔴 Phase 6 |
| **Code Complete** | 100% | 100% | 🟢 Complete |
| **UI Complete** | 100% | 100% | 🟢 Complete |
| **Tests Passing** | 100% | Unit: 100%, Integration: ~70% | 🟡 Phase 5 |
| **Production Deploy** | TRUE | FALSE | 🔴 Phase 7 |

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Permission mismatch after migration** | Medium | High | Dual-mode with comparison reports, pilot testing |
| **Access denial for valid users** | Low | Critical | Progressive rollout, immediate rollback capability |
| **Performance degradation** | Low | Medium | Load testing, query optimization, caching |
| **Data corruption during migration** | Very Low | Critical | Transaction isolation, tested rollback, backups |

**Current Risk Level**: 🟡 Medium - Awaiting Phase 5 test completion and Phase 6 pilot migration
