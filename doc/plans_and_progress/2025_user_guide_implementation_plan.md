# GVV User Guide - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to create a comprehensive user guide for GVV (Gestion Vol à voile) with screenshots captured using Playwright. The guide will be structured around user workflows and stored in `doc/users/` for easy GitHub viewing.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized to support internationalization (i18n). Initial version will be in French, with structure ready for English and Dutch translations.

```

## Key Features Identified

Based on analysis of the codebase, GVV provides:

1. **Member Management** - Users, roles, licenses, sections
2. **Aircraft Fleet** - Gliders (planeur) and towplanes (avion)
3. **Flight Logging** - Manual/automatic flight recording, discovery flights
4. **Flight Calendar** - Flight intentions and scheduling
5. **Billing** - Invoicing, client accounts, tariffs
6. **Accounting** - Double-entry bookkeeping, chart of accounts, bank reconciliation
7. **Reporting** - Various reports and exports
8. **Configuration** - Association settings, fields, permissions
9. **Email Communications** - Member notifications
10. **OpenFlyers Integration** - Account synchronization (already documented)

## User Workflows to Document

### 1. Getting Started (Essential for all users)
- **Login & Authentication** - First connection, password recovery
- **Navigation** - Main menu, sections, responsive design
- **Basic Concepts** - Sections, roles, active/inactive entities

### 2. Member Management (CRUD Example - Detailed)
This will serve as the comprehensive CRUD example:
- **View Members List** - Filters, search, pagination
- **Create New Member** - Form fields, required data, validation
- **View Member Details** - Profile, licenses, history
- **Edit Member** - Updating information, managing licenses
- **Delete/Deactivate Member** - Soft delete vs hard delete
- **Member Roles & Permissions** - Assigning roles per section

### 3. Aircraft Fleet Management
- **View Aircraft List** - Active/inactive filter
- **Add New Aircraft** - Basic workflow only (similar to member creation)
- **Activate/Deactivate Aircraft** - Managing fleet visibility

### 4. Flight Logging
- **Recording Glider Flights** - Manual entry workflow
- **Recording Towplane Flights** - Towplane-specific fields
- **Discovery Flights** - Special workflow for "vols de découverte"
- **Flight List & Filters** - Viewing and searching flights

### 5. Flight Calendar
- **View Calendar** - Monthly/weekly views
- **Add Flight Intention** - Booking workflow
- **Manage Attendance** - Presence tracking

### 6. Billing
- **Generate Invoices** - Billing workflow
- **Client Account Operations** - Credits, debits
- **Tariff Management** - Overview only

### 7. Accounting

- **Export Options** - CSV, PDF formats

## Documentation Principles

1. **Workflow-Oriented** - Focus on "how to accomplish X" rather than "what button Y does"
2. **Minimal Text** - GVV is intuitive, screenshots with brief captions are sufficient
3. **One Detailed CRUD** - Member management shows full CRUD cycle in detail
4. **Other Features** - High-level overview with key screenshots
5. **Progressive Disclosure** - Start simple, add complexity only when needed
6. **i18n Ready** - Initial version in French, structure supports English & Dutch translations
7. **Shared Screenshots** - Where UI text is minimal, screenshots can be shared across languages

## Implementation Steps

## Screenshot Standards

### Technical Settings
- **Browser**: Chromium (Playwright default)
- **Viewport**: 1280x720 (desktop), 768x1024 (tablet)
- **Format**: PNG (lossless)
- **Naming**: Descriptive, numbered: `01_login_page.png`, `02_member_list.png`
- **Language**: French (primary language of the application)

### Quality Guidelines
- Clean test data (no personal information)
- Highlight key UI elements when needed
- Consistent navigation state (same user, same section)
- Full page vs viewport: Use full page for overviews, viewport for specific actions
