' User flows
migrated_user --> decision
admin_user --> decision
nonmigrated_user --> decision

decision --> new_system : Use new
decision --> old_system : Use old

config --> decision
mig_db --> decision

admin_user --> mgmt

note right of decision
  Checks:
  1. Global config flag
  2. User in migrated list
  3. Database migration status
  Returns: OLD or NEW system
end note

note right of mgmt
  Admin can:
  - Migrate individual users
  - Configure permissions for
    non-migrated users
  - Monitor migration status
  - Rollback if needed
end note

note bottom of new_system
  Both systems run in parallel
  No interference between them
  Old tables remain untouched
end note
