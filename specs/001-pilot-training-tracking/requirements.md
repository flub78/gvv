# Feature Specification Quality Checklist

**Feature**: Pilot Training Tracking System  
**Specification File**: `spec.md`  
**Checklist Date**: October 21, 2025

## Core Completeness

### User Stories & Testing
- [x] **Multiple user stories defined**: 4 user stories with clear priority levels (P1-P4)
- [x] **Independent testability**: Each story can be tested and deployed independently
- [x] **Priority-based ordering**: Critical progression tracking (P1) → structured competencies (P2) → reporting (P3) → collaboration (P4)
- [x] **Acceptance criteria using Given/When/Then**: All stories have structured acceptance scenarios
- [x] **Edge cases identified**: 5 edge cases covering transitions, regulatory changes, and data continuity

### Requirements
- [x] **Functional requirements listed**: 13 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-013)
- [x] **Requirements are testable**: All requirements have specific, measurable criteria
- [x] **Key entities defined**: 6 entities (Student Pilot, Progression Record, Training Session, Skill Competency, Training Program, Instructor)
- [x] **Entities show relationships**: Clear relationships between students, instructors, sessions, and competencies

### Success Criteria
- [x] **Measurable outcomes defined**: 7 success criteria with specific metrics
- [x] **Technology-agnostic**: Criteria focus on user outcomes, not implementation details
- [x] **Time-based metrics included**: Session recording times, report generation speed, task completion times

## Quality Indicators

### Clarity & Specificity
- [x] **User stories use plain language**: Written for instructors and administrators without technical jargon
- [x] **Requirements avoid implementation details**: Focus on what the system must do, not how
- [x] **Success criteria are specific and measurable**: Specific percentages, time limits, and completion rates
- [x] **Consistent terminology**: Student pilots, instructors, progression records used consistently

### Stakeholder Value
- [x] **Clear value proposition**: Systematic tracking replacing manual paper-based methods
- [x] **Addresses real user needs**: Based on actual training requirements and instructor workflows
- [x] **Business impact articulated**: Training efficiency, compliance, and standardization benefits
- [x] **User workflows considered**: Multi-instructor collaboration and progression tracking workflows

### Risk Mitigation
- [x] **Dependencies acknowledged**: Integration with existing member management system noted
- [x] **Assumptions documented**: 7 assumptions covering skills, connectivity, regulations, and member registration
- [x] **Data handling considerations**: Complete audit trail and data integrity requirements specified
- [ ] **Regulatory compliance considerations**: ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION** - Aviation training regulations mentioned but specific compliance requirements need clarification

## Specification Readiness Assessment

### Ready for Development ✅
**Strengths**:
- Clear progression from basic tracking to advanced features
- Well-defined entities and relationships suitable for database design
- Measurable success criteria enabling proper testing
- Independent user stories allowing iterative development
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering core workflows

### Areas Requiring Clarification ⚠️

**High Priority**:
1. **FR-012**: Photo/video attachment support for skill demonstrations - needs product decision
2. **FR-013**: Training record retention period - likely regulated by aviation authorities
3. **Regulatory compliance**: Specific aviation training documentation requirements need research

**Medium Priority**:
1. **Aircraft type management**: How should different aircraft training requirements be structured?
2. **Training program customization**: Should clubs be able to define custom training programs or use standardized templates?
3. **Instructor qualification tracking**: Should the system verify instructor qualifications for specific training types?

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (before development): Research aviation training record retention requirements and regulatory compliance needs
2. **Planning phase**: Define photo/video attachment requirements based on club feedback and technical feasibility
3. **Design phase**: Create detailed entity relationship diagrams for database design
4. **Implementation**: Start with P1 (basic progression tracking) as MVP foundation

## Overall Assessment: **READY WITH CLARIFICATIONS**

The specification provides a solid foundation for development with clear user value and well-structured requirements. The identified clarifications are important but do not block initial development of core functionality. The iterative approach with prioritized user stories allows for gathering feedback and refining unclear areas during development.
