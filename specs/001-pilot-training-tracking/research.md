# Phase 0: Research & Technical Decisions

**Feature**: Pilot Training Tracking System  
**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Markdown File Storage Integration

**Decision**: Use hybrid approach with database for structured data and Markdown files for rich content

**Rationale**: 
- Enables version control tracking of training content changes
- Provides easy text-based editing for instructors
- Allows rich formatting for detailed training descriptions
- Maintains database relationships for efficient querying
- Follows GVV's existing file upload patterns in `/uploads/` directory

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure database storage with TEXT fields (rejected: limited formatting, no version control)
- External documentation system (rejected: complexity, integration issues)
- JSON file storage (rejected: less human-readable than Markdown)

**Implementation details**:
- Training program descriptions: `/uploads/training/programs/[program_id].md`
- Student progress sheets: `/uploads/training/students/[student_id]/progress.md`
- Session notes: `/uploads/training/students/[student_id]/sessions/[session_id].md`
- File paths stored in database for efficient querying
- Markdown parsing using existing PHP libraries or simple text display

### 2. GVV Integration Patterns Analysis

**Decision**: Extend existing member management with training-specific models following Common_model pattern

**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing user authentication and authorization
- Reuses established database connection and configuration
- Follows proven GVV patterns for consistent code architecture
- Enables integration with existing reporting and export features

**Integration points identified**:
- `application/models/membres_model.php`: Link student pilots to existing members
- `application/models/common_model.php`: Base class patterns for training models
- `application/libraries/Gvvmetadata.php`: Metadata definitions for training fields
- Existing authorization system for instructor/admin access control

### 3. Training Competency Framework Research

**Decision**: Implement flexible competency system with configurable skill trees

**Rationale**:
- Aviation training has standardized progression requirements
- Different aircraft types require different competency sets
- Instructors need flexibility to adapt to student pace
- Regulatory compliance often requires documented skill validation

**Framework structure**:
- Training programs define competency categories (e.g., pre-solo, solo, cross-country)
- Individual competencies within categories (e.g., "straight and level flight", "emergency procedures")
- Achievement levels: not started, in progress, achieved, needs review
- Instructor validation required for advancement
- Configurable prerequisites between competencies

**Best practices from aviation training**:
- Clear objective criteria for each competency
- Multiple validation opportunities
- Instructor sign-off requirements
- Progress tracking with timestamps
- Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance

### 4. Reporting and Compliance Requirements

**Decision**: Generate reports in multiple formats (web, PDF, CSV) for different stakeholders

**Rationale**:
- Instructors need quick progress overviews during training
- Administrators need statistical summaries for program management
- Regulatory authorities may require specific documentation formats
- Students benefit from progress tracking visibility

**Report types designed**:
- Individual student progress report (current status, completed competencies, next steps)
- Instructor workload report (students assigned, recent sessions, validation queue)
- Program effectiveness report (completion rates, average progression time)
- Regulatory compliance export (structured data for authority submissions)

**Technical implementation**:
- Leverage existing GVV TCPDF library for PDF generation
- Use established CSV export patterns for data downloads
- Web-based reports with Bootstrap 5 styling for consistency
- Caching strategies for performance on large datasets

### 5. File Organization and Security

**Decision**: Structured directory layout with access control integration

**File organization pattern**:
```
uploads/training/
├── programs/
│   ├── glider_basic.md
│   ├── glider_advanced.md
│   └── motor_glider.md
├── students/
│   └── [student_member_id]/
│       ├── progress.md
│       └── sessions/
│           ├── session_20251021_001.md
│           └── session_20251022_002.md
└── templates/
    ├── progress_template.md
    └── session_template.md
```

**Security considerations**:
- Student files only accessible to assigned instructors and administrators
- File permissions aligned with existing GVV upload security
- No direct web access to Markdown files (served through controllers)
- Integration with existing session-based authorization

### 6. Performance and Scalability

**Decision**: Implement efficient querying with minimal file system access

**Optimization strategies**:
- Database stores file paths and metadata for fast queries
- Markdown content loaded only when specifically requested
- Pagination for large student lists and session histories
- Caching of frequently accessed training program descriptions
- Batch operations for progress report generation

**Scalability limits assessed**:
- Target: 50-200 students per club, 5-6 clubs
- Estimated storage: ~1-2MB per student per year
- Database size impact: minimal (primarily relationships and metadata)
- File system impact: well within typical server capabilities

## Technical Clarifications Resolved

### Photo/Video Attachment Support (FR-012)
**Decision**: Start with text-only implementation, design for future multimedia expansion

**Rationale**: 
- Markdown files provide rich text formatting sufficient for initial needs
- File upload infrastructure already exists in GVV
- Future enhancement can add multimedia without architectural changes
- Focus on core functionality for MVP delivery

### Training Record Retention (FR-013)
**Decision**: Implement configurable retention with default 7-year period

**Rationale**:
- Aviation training records typically require extended retention
- Different regions may have different regulatory requirements
- Configuration allows clubs to set appropriate retention policies
- Archive functionality preserves data while maintaining performance

## Dependencies and Risks

**External dependencies**: None (all requirements met with existing GVV stack)

**Risk mitigation**:
- File system backup strategy aligns with existing GVV backup procedures
- Database migration scripts provide rollback capabilities
- Gradual rollout allows instructor training and feedback incorporation
- Existing GVV patterns reduce implementation and maintenance risks

**Testing strategy**:
- Unit tests for model and library functionality
- Integration tests for file system and database interactions
- Controller tests for form handling and report generation
- End-to-end playwright tests for complete user workflows

## Next Phase Requirements

All research tasks complete. Ready for Phase 1 design phase:
- Data model definition
- API contract specification  
- Database migration planning
- User interface mockups
- Testing framework setup
