# Feature Specification: Pilot Training Tracking System

**Feature Branch**: `001-pilot-training-tracking`  
**Created**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Système de suivi de formation pour les pilotes - gestion des fiches de progression, compétences acquises, et validation des étapes de formation"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Manage Pilot Progression Records (Priority: P1)

As a flight instructor, I want to create and maintain detailed progression records for each student pilot so that I can track their learning journey and ensure they meet training requirements before advancing to the next level.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables systematic pilot training tracking. Without progression records, instructors cannot document student achievements or identify gaps in training.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a student record, adding progression entries, and viewing the complete training history. Delivers immediate value for instructor-student tracking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an instructor is logged into the system, **When** they create a new progression record for a student, **Then** the record is saved with student details, training objectives, and current status
2. **Given** a progression record exists, **When** the instructor updates skill achievements or adds training notes, **Then** the changes are timestamped and preserved in the training history
3. **Given** multiple progression records exist, **When** the instructor views the student list, **Then** they can see the current training status and progress level of each student

### User Story 2 - Track and Validate Skill Competencies (Priority: P2)

As a flight instructor, I want to define specific skills and competencies for each training level and mark them as achieved when students demonstrate proficiency, so that training progression follows standardized requirements.

**Why this priority**: Ensures consistent training standards and provides clear milestones for student advancement. Builds upon the basic progression tracking with structured competency validation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by defining skill sets for a training level, assigning them to students, and marking competencies as achieved. Delivers structured competency-based training progression.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** skill competencies are defined for a training level, **When** an instructor evaluates a student's performance, **Then** they can mark specific skills as achieved or requiring additional practice
2. **Given** a student has completed required competencies, **When** the instructor reviews their progression, **Then** the system indicates readiness for advancement to the next training level
3. **Given** competency requirements exist, **When** generating training reports, **Then** the system shows which skills are completed, in progress, or not yet started

### User Story 3 - Generate Training Progress Reports (Priority: P3)

As a club administrator or chief instructor, I want to generate comprehensive training progress reports for individual students or training cohorts so that I can analyze training effectiveness and ensure regulatory compliance.

**Why this priority**: Provides oversight and reporting capabilities for training program management. Important for club administration but not essential for day-to-day training activities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating reports for students with existing progression data. Delivers analytical insights into training program effectiveness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** progression data exists for multiple students, **When** generating a training overview report, **Then** the system displays current training statistics, completion rates, and students requiring attention
2. **Given** a specific time period is selected, **When** generating training activity reports, **Then** the system shows training sessions conducted, skills validated, and student advancement during that period
3. **Given** regulatory reporting requirements, **When** exporting training data, **Then** the system provides standardized training records suitable for aviation authority submissions

---

### User Story 4 - Multi-Instructor Collaboration (Priority: P4)

As a flight instructor, I want to see training notes and assessments from other instructors for the same student so that I can provide consistent instruction and build upon previous training sessions.

**Why this priority**: Enhances training quality through instructor collaboration but is not essential for basic progression tracking functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having multiple instructors add notes to the same student record and verifying information sharing. Delivers improved training continuity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple instructors teach the same student, **When** accessing the student's progression record, **Then** each instructor can view training notes and assessments from other instructors
2. **Given** different instructors have different specializations, **When** a student works with a new instructor, **Then** the instructor can see the student's complete training history and current competency status

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a student moves between different training programs or aircraft types?
- How does the system handle retroactive changes to training requirements or competency definitions?
- What occurs when training records need to be transferred between different clubs or schools?
- How does the system manage training records for students who take extended breaks or return after inactivity?
- What happens when regulatory training requirements change and existing records need updates?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow instructors to create progression records for individual student pilots with student identification, training program type, and start date
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable instructors to define and manage skill competencies organized by training levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced, solo, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow instructors to record training session details including date, duration, aircraft used, skills practiced, and instructor observations
- **FR-004**: System MUST enable marking of specific competencies as achieved, in progress, or requiring additional practice with validation dates and instructor signatures
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain complete training history for each student with timestamped entries that cannot be deleted, only amended with explanatory notes
- **FR-006**: System MUST support progression through defined training levels with automatic advancement suggestions based on completed competencies
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate training reports showing individual student progress, competency completion status, and recommended next steps
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow multiple instructors to access and update the same student's progression record while maintaining individual instructor attribution
- **FR-009**: System MUST support different aircraft types and training programs with program-specific competency requirements
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with existing member management to link progression records to club member profiles
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide search and filtering capabilities to find students by name, training level, instructor, or progression status
- **FR-012**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the system support photo/video attachments for skill demonstrations or maintain text-only records?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle training record archival for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the required retention period for training records - regulatory compliance may specify minimum retention periods?]

### Key Entities
