# Tasks: Pilot Training Tracking System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-pilot-training-tracking/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests will be included following GVV PHPUnit standards with 70%+ coverage target.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

## Path Conventions
- **GVV Extension**: `application/controllers/`, `application/models/`, `application/views/training/`
- **Database**: `application/migrations/`, `application/config/migration.php`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 progression records but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses data from US1/US2 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1 functionality but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before controllers
- Controllers before views
- Core implementation before integration features
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create unit test for Training_model in application/tests/unit/Training_model_test.php"
Task: "Create integration test for progression CRUD operations in application/tests/integration/Training_integration_test.php"
Task: "Create controller test for training endpoints in application/tests/controllers/Training_controller_test.php"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create training_programs_model.php extending Common_model"
Task: "Create training_sessions_model.php extending Common_model"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Create and Manage Pilot Progression Records)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently using progression record creation and viewing
5. Deploy/demo basic training tracking to instructors

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready with database and core infrastructure
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP: Basic progression tracking!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Enhanced: Competency validation!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Advanced: Comprehensive reporting!)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Complete: Multi-instructor collaboration!)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (progression records)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (competencies)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (reporting)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. User Story 4 (collaboration) can be added by any developer after US1 is complete

## GVV-Specific Considerations

### Environment Requirements
- **CRITICAL**: Always run `source setenv.sh` before any PHP development
- Use PHP 7.4 specifically - newer versions not compatible
- Follow CodeIgniter 2.x patterns and conventions throughout

### Integration Points
- Leverage existing `application/models/common_model.php` patterns
- Integrate with existing `application/models/membres_model.php` for student/instructor data
- Use existing `application/models/avions_model.php` for aircraft assignments
- Follow established metadata-driven architecture in `application/libraries/Gvvmetadata.php`

### Testing Standards
- Achieve 70%+ PHPUnit test coverage following GVV standards
- Use existing test categories: unit, integration, controller, mysql
- Run `./run-all-tests.sh` frequently to check for regressions
- Create playwright end-to-end tests for complete workflows

### File Management
- Follow existing GVV upload security patterns
- Use established file permission management
- Integrate with existing backup and archival procedures
- Maintain directory structure consistency with GVV conventions

- Training continuity between instructors is preserved

### Code Quality Validation
- PHPUnit test coverage > 70% for all training modules
- No regressions in existing GVV functionality
- All PHP files pass syntax validation (`php -l`)
- Metadata-driven field rendering working correctly
- Database migrations run successfully without errors

### Integration Success
- Student data properly links to existing member records
- Aircraft assignments integrate with existing aircraft management
- Authorization follows existing GVV role system
- File uploads follow established security patterns
- Multi-language support works for French, English, Dutch

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies on incomplete work
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for independent development
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Always verify tests fail before implementing features
- Commit after each task or logical group completion
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Follow GVV constitution and development guidelines throughout
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing GVV features
